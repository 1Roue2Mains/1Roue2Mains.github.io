In this age of mobile working, **LA VAGABONDE** is the ideal traveling companion.
<br/> A true *mobile office* for everyday use, without nails or screws. 
It can also serve as a *side table* for hotels and restaurants looking for unique furniture.

> I create solid wood serving trolleys, entirely handmade in France, in the pure tradition of craftsmanship.
> My models are distinguished in particular by their wooden wheels, designed according to the **ancestral know-how of wheelwrights**, a *unique signature that combines elegance and authenticity*.
> **Each trolley can be customised**: choice of wood species, dimensions, integrated features depending on use (coffee, aperitif, cheese, magazines, etc.) and type of wheel; ***from traditional cart wheels to contemporary designs***.

*Price: starting at â‚¬2,000 including tax*.
