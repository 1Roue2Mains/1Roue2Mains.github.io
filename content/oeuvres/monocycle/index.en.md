It all started with a promise. A promise to build a wooden unicycle for my nephews.

The promise turned into a small challenge and a series of exciting discoveries and encounters.
*And since June 2025, it's been rolling along. No tires. No fuss.*
Designed and crafted by myself.

The Mono d'Antan.

**The wheelwright's monocycle weighs 12.6 kg. The wheel is made of ash (hub and rims) and robinia (spokes). 
The fork and saddle are made of ash. The axle and rim are made of steel.**

*Custom height / 24-inch wheel / Choice of wood types for the saddle and pedals / Oiled finish.*

> *You know, questioning the unicycle, I think, is above all about redefining the concept of progress.
> By progress, I mean that movement we have been searching for in vain since prehistoric times.*
