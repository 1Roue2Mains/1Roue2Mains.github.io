**Charlotte** is a Belgian designer and cabinetmaker. 
After studying industrial design in Liège and furniture design in Florence, 
she trained in cabinetmaking in France, in the Alps in the heart of the Ubaye Valley. 

**Pierre** is a French landscape architect, engineer and cabinetmaker.
Passionate about local resources and craftsmanship,
he also trained at the Ecole Supérieure d'Ebénisterie de Haute-Provence (Higher School of Cabinetmaking in Haute-Provence).

It was at the school, around the workbench, that our two neighbours met and shared their desire to create **furniture and objects in solid wood**,
guided by their curiosity and the discoveries they love to share.
Ash, walnut, oak, elm and larch: the selection and combination of distinctive wood species nourish their creative work.
*Tables, chairs, lamps, mirrors, trays, furniture*: the beginnings of a happy and daring collaboration to be continued :)
