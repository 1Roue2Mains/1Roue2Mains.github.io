The years go by and you inherit **a piece of furniture from Granny**.

You don't want to throw it away. Even if it's falling apart. Restore it? Give it away?
After all, **it was in Granny's bedroom**.

Contact me: I'll take it apart and salvage what I can to *create a contemporary piece of furniture for your living room*.

**Mirror, tray, piece of furniture, anything is possible.** 

A memory of Grandma in your home.
